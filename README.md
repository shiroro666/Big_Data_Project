# Big_Data_Project
This project presents the data analysis on datasets which are related to transportation in NYC during COVID-19 pandemic. 

Here is the description of the tasks


## Task0:
For each day, compute daily cases and cumulative cases (total and for different borough):

date, new_case_count, cumulative_total, bx_case_count, bx_cumulative_total, bk_case_count, bk_cumulative_total, mn_case_count, mn_cumulative_total, qn_case_count, qn_cumulative_total, si_case_count, si_cumulative_total
example(2020-01-01,14,150,3,30,2,10,3,60,2,10,4,40)

## Task1:
Daily average exit/entry on subway turnstile data (each month)
### (a) For each borough, compute total exits/entries each day
example(day, borough, total entries, total exits)
(2020-01-01, Bk, 100000, 200000)
### (b) For each day, compute total entries/exit (2020 and 2019)
(2020-01-01, 10000000, 20000000)
### (c) Join a) and b) with covid-19 result on borough and day
example(day, borough, borough_new cases, borough_cumulative cases, total entries, total exits)
### (d) For daily_transit_ridership, select date, current(current date’s ridership), baseline(last year’s ridership, same weekday of same week number) where Agency = New York City MTA Rail
example(date, 2020_daily_ridership, 2019_daily_ridership)
### (e) Join b) and d) on date
example(2019date, 2019entrie, 2019exits, 2019_daily_ridership)
(2019-01-01, 123345, 123346, 2864331)
### (f) Join d with covid-19 data, compute the difference between 2020 and 2019
example(date, 2020_daily_ridership, 2019_daily_ridership, 2020/2019, 2019-2020, new_cases, cumulative cases)


## Task2:
Average bicycle counts
### (a) Join bicycle_count(site, date, count) and bicycle_counters(site, name) on “site” (only on date inside the range of [03/01/2020, 11/30/2020] and  [03/01/2019, 11/30/2019] ), reduce by date(do the summation of the counts at any time on that day)
(08/31/2020, 100062893, Broadway at 50th St, 100)
### (b) Compute total count each day and compare with the day in previous year
(08/31/2020, 2000, 1000)
### (c) Monthly avg join with task 0
(month, avg_2020_month, avg_2019_month, avg_cases)
(2020-01 12222.0 22222.0, 22222)


## Task3:
Citibike data analysis 
### (a) For each dataset(There are 18 datasets), extract trip_duration and start_date
example(duration(seconds), date)
example(239, 2019-08-08)
…...
example(280, 2020-01-01)
### (b) For each result generated by (a), compute each day’s total amount of trip and avg

example (date, total, avg_duration)
example (2019-03-01, 100, 150)
Join 2019 new dataset with 2020 on the day with same week number and weekday
### (c) Range = [0, 300],[300, 600], [600, 900], [900, 1200], [1200,~]
example(date, range, num)
example(2020-01-01, range1, 10000)
### (d) Join (b) with task0 data on the date
example(date, total_trip_count, average_trip_duration, new_cases, cumulative_cases
(2020-03-01, 90, 290, 111, 1111)
